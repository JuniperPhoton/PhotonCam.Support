# Manage filters

Aside from using the built-in filters, PhotonCam allows you to create your own filters while in capturing photos or in editing photos.

## Create your filter when capturing

When you open the filter panel by clicking the right-bottom icon, not only you can choose which filter to be applied, you can also click the "+" icon on the left to start a filter creation.

You can then adjust the parameters and the preview will update in real time to reflect your changes.

By clicking the "Ã—" button, a prompt will be shown to let you choose to save this as a new filter or not. You can choose a preferred color to mark this filter. 

However, you can only edit the filter name in the filer management page.

## Create your filter in image edit

In image edit page, you can select a filter to use and tweak its parameters. If you are satisfied with this new filter, you can tap the "..." icon in the Filters tab and choose "Save as a new filter".

This operation will create a new filter based on the parameters you tweak.

Note that even using the built-in filters, you can still tweak the parameters of it. 

For example, you find that the built-in A1 filter is good for this photo, but the exposure is a bit low. Then you can tweak the exposure parameter and save it as a new filter, named "A1 with Exposure tweaked". (Note that renaming filters requires you to go the filter management page.)

## Duplicate a filter to edit

In the filter management page, you can create a new filter and starting editing its parameter by clicking the bottom-right button. 

To duplicate a filter, you can enter the filter detail page, and click the "Duplicate" button below, which will add a new filter, copying all of its parameters. Then you can tweak its parameters.

> Note that you can also duplicate the built-in filters and tweak more parameters of them. Some built-in filters use external LUT and some of them use built-in color grading tools.

## Export filters to share or backup
